                My story as a programmer begins during the period of the pandemic that we have suffered throughout the world. At that time I finished my degree in Psychology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. However, with all the changes that this pandemic brought, I realized that I had to deconstruct all my ideas and dreams about the future.
